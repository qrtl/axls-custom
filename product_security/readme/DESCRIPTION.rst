This module restricts the updating of product categories for products to only those users
in the group_product_manager group.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

In certain situations, updating the product category can affect the costing method and stock valuation.
This module provides a control mechanism to ensure only authorized personnel can make such changes,
thereby safeguarding the integrity of the inventory and financial data.
