This module adds a new model Product Shelf Information (product.shelfinfo) to keep
the static shelf details per product per location, and show the information in
relevant transactions and reports to facilitate warehouse operations.

Configuration
=============

Go to the menu items under *Inventory > Settings > Product Shelf Info* and create
area 1, area 2 and position records to be selected in the product shelf information
accordingly.

Usage
=====

Go to *Inventory > Products > Product Shelf Information* and create records for
combinations of product, location and company. These records show in product forms
