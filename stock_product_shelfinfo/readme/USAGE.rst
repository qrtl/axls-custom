Go to *Inventory > Products > Product Shelf Information* and create records for
combinations of product, location and company. These records show in product forms
(Inventory tab) as well.

Generated ID (name) of the Shelf Information record should show for relevant internal
locations in the stock move records of the picking form, as well as in the picking
report, to facilitate the picking/store operations.
