Following settings should be updated:

- Set Plan Type in relevant analytic plans. Plan Type decides which
  column of the OBC data the analytic account will be mapped to.
- Set 'OBC Tax Category' and 'OBC Tax Rate Type' in tax records. These
  settings are used to show in the corresponding columns in the exported
  CSV file.
