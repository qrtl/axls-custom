This module adds a CSV import function to create new products based on the data received
from the PLM system.

This module depends on base_data_import module.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

Update fields in the company (in the 'PLM I/F' tab):

- PLM Path: the absolute path to the PLM directory to fetch the files from.
- PLM Notification Body: the text will be included in the notification email body.
- PLM Notified Groups: assign groups to notify when a new file is fetched from the PLM.

Users can specify field mappings generated from PLM to be applied to product fields in Odoo from PLM-Product Mapping menu.
In the PLM-Product Mapping menu, there are two rules available for applying purchase descriptions to the products:
- Standard Description: The purchase description will be generated using values from the Generic Name, Drawing No, and Spec fields, with the format: "Generic Name / Drawing No / Spec."
- PLM Description: The purchase description will be generated using the value from the description field of the plm.product model.

Usage
=====

There are three ir.cron records added by this module:

#. PLM: Import PLM Products
   The main cron job that imports PLM product records into Odoo in a periodical manner.
#. PLM: Create products based on imported PLM records
   A job that creates products in Odoo based on the imported PLM records. Triggerd by
   the main job.
#. PLM: Send email notification on PLM data import
   A job that sends email notifications to the relevant users. Triggerd by the main job.
   Notification email is designed to be sent only once per the log record.

Alternatively, users can import PLM product records manually via 'Product PLM Import'
wizard, which also triggers the last two jobs.

The status of an import log record becomes 'Done' when a product is successfully created
or marked as 'Solved' for all the imported records.
