Update fields in the company (in the 'PLM I/F' tab):

- PLM Path: the absolute path to the PLM directory to fetch the files from.
- PLM Notification Body: the text will be included in the notification email body.
- PLM Notified Groups: assign groups to notify when a new file is fetched from the PLM.

To setup the field mappings, go to *Data Import > Data Import Settings > PLM-Product Mapping*.

The PLM-Product Mapping menu allows users to define field mappings that are used to
identify and link imported records from PLM for updating the corresponding fields in
the product records in Odoo.
